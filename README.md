# Rouh AlRiyadh 🎡

**My first hands-on project in Data Science highlighting the events happening in Riyadh during the month of May.**

## 💡 Project Idea

This project displays Riyadh’s upcoming events using an interactive interface built with Streamlit, with filtering options based on:

- Type of event (Entertainment, Culture, Art…)
- Date

The data was collected using Web Scraping techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping)

## 🚀 Run the Project public

To run this project on your local machine:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
